# bme688-i2c-micropython
Adafruit's bme688 i2c driver modified to work with micropython

This is my fork of  CRCibernetica/bme688-i2c-micropython which implements the lookup tables for the gas sensor reading.

I use this library in https://github.com/CollinNHays/picow-micropython-MQTT-DHT11-BME688-SCD41
